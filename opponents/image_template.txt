#NOTE: All image descriptions MUST be VERSION 40!
#To convert them, import them into kisekae version 40, then export them again.

#To fill in the blank lines, make the character in kisekae as you want them to appear, then export their character description (click on the pink pen and paper icon, then "export") and copy and paste the description text into the appropriate place here.

##Appearance
#This is how a character looks, and what doesn't change between different stages or image names
appearance=



##Emotions
#These are values that change depending on both the stage and the image. These include blush/red face level, blue face level, blush sticker, and erectness for characters with penises
#The code will add up the stage_emotion number and the image_emotion number to pick out an emotion from this list
#So put the emotion descriptions in top-to-bottom order from "most calm" to "most embarrassed/excited/aroused/whatever"
#You can have as many or as few entries here as you want, as long as there as at least one
