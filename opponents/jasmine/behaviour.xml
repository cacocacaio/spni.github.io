		 - Minor articles of clothing expose a little bit of skin when removed (jackets and socks).
		 - Extra articles of clothing expose very little when removed (hats, belts, and gloves).

	<!-- Dialogue and Expression -->
	<behaviour>	
	
		<!-- Dialogue is split up into stages based on the character's current state of dress or action.
			 - The first stage is always the fully dressed stage.
			 - The two stages following the naked stage are always the masturbation and rest stages.
			 
			 In each stage is a set of cases, each indicating a unique situation requiring dialogue.
			 - The tag and comment will tell you what the situation is.
			 - If multiple cases with the same tag are listed in the same stage, then the game will choose 
			   one of them at random to use.
			 
			 In each case is a set of states, each indicating a single line of dialogue and corresponding image.
			 - If there are multiple states in a single case, the game will display a dialogue advance button,
			   which will allow the player to manually advance through each state.
			   
			 Also included from the code side are replaceable tags that can be used in any applicable line of dialogue.
			 ~name~ will be replaced with the name of AI or player in question, if applicable.
			 ~clothing~ will be replaced with the lower-case name of the clothing being removed, if applicable.
			 ~Clothing~ will be replaced with the upper-case name of the clothing being removed, if applicable.
			 ~cards~ is the number of cards being exchanged, where applicable. -->
