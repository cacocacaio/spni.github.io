CLOTHES:

When she starts, Jasmine should be wearing her 'street rat' cloak, like so:

(Note: it's important that her earrings and necklace be visible, because she takes them off before the cloak.  One image of how this could appear is here: http://www.filmtopp.se/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Aladdin-disneyscreencaps_com-2022.jpg)

After she removes the cloak, Jasmine should have her famous outfit:

(This image also includes her necklace and earrings, but they will be removed by this point. She will have her diadem and slippers still).

I have no idea what kind of panties she would wear.

Jasmine doesn't really have awkward/embarrassed/confused moments, but here are a couple pictures that could help:
